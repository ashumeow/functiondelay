// Add time delays where one function must wait till the previous function gets completed
// Time delay logic = A function must wait until the another functions completes the process.

// deliverables
// no test values should be added in any class
// submit output with screenshots

// Must have prior knowledge in,
// 1. classes
// 2. methods
// 3. objects
// 4. multithreading
```
